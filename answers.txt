1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, basic reproductive rate)

==> See below:

    - Population Size: 1,000
    - Vaccination Percentage: 90%
    - Virus Name: Polio
    - Mortality Rate: 22%
    - Basic Reproduction Number: 60%
    - People Initially Infected: 23

==> using `python3 simulation.py 1000 0.90 Polio 0.22 0.60 23`


2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

==> At its highest, 7.2% of the population was infected at the same time (72 out of 1000).
==> (Fun fact: 30.7% people were infected at some point during the simulation).

3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?

==> At the end of the simulation, 2.6% of the population was infected (26 of 1000).

4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?

==> 11917 interactions occurred between a vaccinated person and an infected person. Wow!!
